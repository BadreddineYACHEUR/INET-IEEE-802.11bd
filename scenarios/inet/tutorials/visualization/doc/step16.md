title: Step 16. Displaying 802.11 channel access method
tutorial: Visualization
---

## Goals

Several mechanisms are used as a part of 802.11 channel access to minimize 
the likelihood of frame collisions. This function is necessary because 
the wireless medium is half-duplex. For this reason, it is often useful 
to display information about the access state of nodes. INET provides 
a visualizer that display IEEE MAC 802.11 contention states during 
the channel access method. This information is contained in submodules. 
By visualizing this information, we get a clear picture about the contention states 
of network nodes at a glance, without going deep into submodules.

## The model

<!--
Firstly we hide some visualizers, because they are distracting.
The communication is the same as in the previous step, we have to configure only the visualizer.
To display the channel access states, we use infoVisualizer. <br>
Here is the configuration:
@dontinclude omnetpp.ini
@skipline [Config Visualization14]
@until ####

The module parameter specifies the submodules of network nodes, and the content
determines what is displayed on network nodes. In addition we can adjust the
background color, the font color, and the opacity. These are optional settings.

## Results

Here's what happens, when the simulation is running:

We see, the nodes wait until the channel is sensed to be idle. If the medium is clear,
instead of immediately transmitting network nodes are waiting a predefined amount of time.
This waiting period is called the interframe spacing (IFS).
It depends on the priority of the packet.
In addition to having a different IFS, a station will add a "random backoff"
to its waiting period, to reduce the collision probability.
After that the the network node starts transmitting the data, and it's owning the channel.
