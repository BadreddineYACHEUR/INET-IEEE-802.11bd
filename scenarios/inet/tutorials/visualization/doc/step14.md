title: Step 14. Displaying statistics
tutorial: Visualization

## Goals
Statistics are important factors of simulation. They are collected in simulation time 
and usually examined and evaluated after simulation has ended. From the statistics 
it can be concluded whether the simulation works properly. Sometimes we need a 
quick overview in simulation time whether the simulation is working as expected. 
INET provides a visualizer that can show statistical data in simulation time.
In this step, we display a statistic about VoIP packet's end-to-end delay.

## The model
`StatisticVisualizer` (included in the network as part of `IntegratedVisualizer`) 
keeps track of the last values of statistics, 
and displays them above the icon of the network node.

In this tutorial, we show statistic about end-to-end delay of VoIP traffic 
between `pedestrian0` and `pedestrian1`. The visualizer subscribes for the 
*VoIPPacketDelay* signal selected with the `signalName` parameter 
and displays the *endToEndDelay* statistic selected with the `statisticName` parameter.
We set the `sourceFilter` parameter to *"\*.pedestrian1.udpApp\[0\]"*. 
Visualizer displays the statistic of that module at the node that contains the module. 

The default unit of *endToEndDelay* statistic is the second, but packet delay in VoIP 
communication is measured in milliseconds (*ms*) so we set `unit` to *ms*. 
We set `textColor` to *yellow* and `backgroundColor` to *grey*, 
because it looks better in the playground.
