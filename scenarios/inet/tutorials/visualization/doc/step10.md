title: Step 10. Displaying transmissions and receptions
tutorial: Visualization
---

## Goals
In wireless network simulations, it is important to get information about 
signal transmissions and receptions. By displaying transmission and reception states, 
we can get a clear overview about wireless transmissions in the network. We can see 
which nodes are transmitting and which nodes are receiving signals at a given time.
In this step, we visualize nodes' transmission and reception states.

## The model
### VoIP application

<pre class="snippet" src="../omnetpp.ini" from="\[Config Visualization10\]" until="# displaying transmissions & receptions"></pre>

First, we set up communication between `pedestrian0` and `pedestrian1` 
to generate network traffic.
In INET, VoIP communication is implemented in two applications. `SimpleVoIPSender` 
is a constant bitrate source, with talkspurt support added. `SimpleVoIPReceiver` 
receives a VoIP stream generated by a SimpleVoIPSender, and records statistics. 
Details of configuring VoIP communication is out of scope in this tutorial, 
you can read more in the NED documentation of `SimpleVoIPSender` and `SimpleVoIPReceiver`.

### Visualization
We configure `visualizer` as follows.
<pre class="snippet" src="../omnetpp.ini" from="# displaying transmissions & receptions" until="#---"></pre>

Transmission and reception states are displayed by `MediumVisualizer`. They can be enabled 
separately by setting `displayTransmissions` and `displayReceptions` to *true*. 
Transmission and reception state is displayed as an icon around the node. 
The displacement priority of these icons is set to a higher value because we want 
association icon and IP address closer to the node. 

For 3D visualization, we can use animated gif image as icon. 
We replace icon of transmission and reception state 
by changing `transmissionImage` and `receptionImage`.
Image path must be the relative path to the *inet/images* folder.

If we start the simulation, we can see clearly, who is the transmitter, and who are the receivers.
The signs appear, when a signal arrives or leaves the wlan NIC.
