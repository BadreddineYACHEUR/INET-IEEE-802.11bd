title: Step 22. Showing link break - WIP

## Goals

When a mobile node moves out from an access point's communication range the link 
breaks up and the nodes can't communicate with each other any more. This leads to 
packet loss. When the sender node does not get an ACK frame from the receiver node 
for a long time, the link breaks between the nodes. In this step, we display 
link break between network nodes.
