Coexistence

1. Independent frequency bands

Different kind of technologies can coexist

- 2 wifi on non-overlapping channels
- wifi + 802.15.4 on non-overlapping channels

use scalar radio -> easier to use two radio mediums because of optimization

2. Exacly overlapping frequency bands

The frequency bands overlap in frequency and bandwidth

wifi + 802.15.4
-> this doesn't seem realistic because the two doesn't have the same fr and bw

but this way this can use scalar radio

3. Partially overlapping frequency bands

or completely overlapping

this is more realistic...use dimensional

they can completely overlap meaning one spectrum contains the other in the middle

Idea: 1. independent fr band, 1 radio medium, scalar
      2. independent fr band, 2 radio mediums, scalar -> should compare the preformance of the two
                      and how it scales
