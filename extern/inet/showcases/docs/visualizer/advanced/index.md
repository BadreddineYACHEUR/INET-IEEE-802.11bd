- TODO: The title could be "Advanced Visualizer module use cases" or not NOPE
- TODO: emphasize how this visualization needs two visualizer modules
- TODO: another configuration where there are two radioMediums -> need two visualizers
      there are 2.4 and 5 GHz wifi hosts...the frequency should be color coded

## Goals

```
TODO: another angle: it is possible to create more complex visualizations
by including multiple visualizer modules, which can be configured independently.
The focus is on the possibility...not the need

More complex visualizations can be created by using more than one visualizer.
Something like that.
```

V2

It is possible to create more complex visualization by using multiple visualizer modules modules
of the same type instead of just one. The modules can be configured independently, providing a flexible way to customize visualization of complex simulations. For example, it can be useful to configure different path visualizations for different parts of the network.

V3

The modules can be configured independently, providing a flexible way to customize visualization of complex simulations.
The modules can be configured independently to suit visualization of complex simulations.

V1

Complex simulations can benefit from complex visualization to better
understand what is happening in the network. Multiple visualizer modules of the same type can be included in the network if the desired visualization cannot be accomplished with a single
visualizer module. The various visualizer modules can be configured
independently, providing a flexible way to customize visualizations to
one's needs. For example, one can configure different path visualizations for different parts of the network.

This showcase describes the various types of compound visualizer
modules, such as `IntegratedVisualizer`. It demonstrates the
use of multiple visualizers with two example simulations, and shows how
the visualization settings can be modified at runtime. Finally, it
demonstrates how to add your own visualizer types to the existing
compound visualizer modules.

## About visualizer module types

INET contains visualizer simple modules suitable for a single visualization task,
such as `RoutingTableCanvasVisualizer` or
`InterfaceTableOsgVisualizer`. However, there are visualizer
compound modules, which contain multiple single-task visualizer simple modules. One has to include just one
compound visualizer module in the network, and multiple visualizers can be configured from the ini file.
The following section aims to clarify the various simple and compound visualizer module types available
in INET.

- **Canvas and Osg simple modules**

  There are separate types of visualizer simple modules for 2D and
  3D visualization. 2D visualization is implemented by `Canvas
  visualizer` modules, while 3D visualization is handled by
  `Osg visualizers`. The visualizer simple modules have the
  word `Canvas` or `Osg` in their type names, e.g.
  `RoutingTableCanvasVisualizer` or
  `StatisticOsgVisualizer`.

- **Compound modules of Canvas and Osg visualizers**

  There are compound modules containing the Canvas and Osg versions of
  single-task visualizers, e.g. the
  `RoutingTableVisualizer` compound module contains a
  `RoutingTableCanvasVisualizer` and a
  `RoutingTableOsgVisualizer` simple module.
  These single-task compound visualizers can provide both 2D and 3D visualizations (i.e. the RoutingTableVisualizer module can visualize routing tables in both 2D and 3D.) A rule of thumb
  is if the type name doesn't contain either `Canvas` or
  `Osg`, the module contains both kinds of visualizers.

  <img class="screen" src="compound.png">

- **Integrated Canvas and Osg visualizers**

  The `IntegratedCanvasVisualizer` and
  `IntegratedOsgVisualizer` compound modules each contain all
  available Canvas and Osg visualizer types, respectively.

  <img class="screen" src="integratedcanvasosg.png">

- **Integrated visualizer**

  The `IntegratedVisualizer` contains an
  `IntegratedCanvasVisualizer` and a
  `IntegratedOsgVisualizer`. Thus it contains all
  available visualizers.

  <img class="screen" src="integrated.png">

- **Multi-visualizers**

  Multi-visualizers are compound visualizer modules containing submodule vectors of visualizer simple modules. Such visualizers are useful if multiple visualizers of the same type are required for creating complex visualizations. The available multi visualizer modules are `IntegratedMultiCanvasVisualizer` and `IntegratedMultiOsgVisualizer`, each containing submodule vectors of canvas and osg visualizer simple modules. The `IntegratedMultiVisualizer` contains both an `IntegratedMultiCanvasVisualizer` and an `IntegratedMultiOsgVisualizer`, similarly to `IntegratedVisualizer`. By default, the canvas and osg multi visualizers contain one submodule of each visualizer simple module. The number of submodules can be specified for each visualizer submodule with parameters, e.g. `numTransportConnectionVisualizers = 2` or `numDataLinkVisualizers = 3`.

## Including multiple visualizer modules

Visualizations from multiple visualizer modules of the same type can be
combined to create more complex visualizations that would not be
possible using a single visualizer module. In this section, we present
two example simulations that demonstrates the use of two visualizer
modules. The configurations for the simulations are defined in the
omnetpp.ini file. TODO: rewrite for two configs The configuration uses the following network:

<img class="screen" src="network.png">

The hosts and the server in the network are `StandardHosts`.
The network contains two `IntegratedVisualizer` modules, named
`visualizer1` and `visualizer2`.

The `server` runs an UDP video stream server
(`UDPVideoStreamSvr`), and two `TCPSessionApps`. These
applications are configured to send UDP and TCP streams to certain
hosts:

-   `host2` and `host4` are configured to send UDP
    video stream requests to the server, which in turn sends UDP streams
    to the hosts.
-   The `server` is configured to send TCP streams to
    `host3` and `host5`.

The goal is to visualize UDP and TCP streams with different colors, so
it is easier to differentiate between them. We configure the
`NetworkRouteVisualizer` in `visualizer1` to display
TCP packet paths with blue arrows, and the
`NetworkRouteVisualizer` in `visualizer2` to indicate
UDP packet paths with red arrows.

```
*.visualizer1.networkRouteVisualizer.displayRoutes = true
*.visualizer1.networkRouteVisualizer.packetFilter = "*tcp* or *ACK* or *SYN*"
*.visualizer1.networkRouteVisualizer.lineColor = "blue"

*.visualizer2.networkRouteVisualizer.displayRoutes = true
*.visualizer2.networkRouteVisualizer.packetFilter = "*Video*"
*.visualizer2.networkRouteVisualizer.lineColor = "red"
```

The TCP visualization is configured to display all TCP packets,
including the ones that take part in establishing the connection, i.e.
the ACK, SYN+ACK, and SYN. The other visualizer is configured to
visualize all UDP packets (packets with 'Video' in their names, which
covers all UDP packets in the network).

The `StatisticVisualizer` in `visualizer1` is
configured to display the number of received UDP packets in the affected
nodes. The other `StatisticVisualizer` in
`visualizer2` is configured to indicate the total size of the
received TCP data.

```
*.visualizer1.statisticVisualizer.displayStatistics = true
*.visualizer1.statisticVisualizer.signalName = "passedUpPk"
*.visualizer1.statisticVisualizer.sourceFilter = "**.udp"
*.visualizer1.statisticVisualizer.format = "UDP packets received: %v"

*.visualizer2.statisticVisualizer.displayStatistics = true
*.visualizer2.statisticVisualizer.signalName = "rcvdPk"
*.visualizer2.statisticVisualizer.statisticName = "rcvdBytes"
*.visualizer2.statisticVisualizer.unit = "KiB"
*.visualizer2.statisticVisualizer.sourceFilter = "**.tcpApp[*]"
*.visualizer2.statisticVisualizer.format = "TCP data received: %v %u"
```

Additionally, the `TransportConnectionVisualizer` in
`visualizer1` is enabled, and set to visualize transport
connections in the network, i.e. the TCP connections. The set of colors for the icons to use is set to yellow and green.

<!--
V2
Additionally, the `TransportConnectionVisualizer` in
`visualizer1` is enabled, and set to visualize transport
connections in the network, i.e. the TCP connections. The set of colors for the icons to use is set to blue and darkblue to differentiate the two TCP connections.
-->

TODO: why cant it be blue?

TODO: maybe it should be two shades of blue (darkblue, lightblue)

```
*.visualizer1.transportConnectionVisualizer.displayTransportConnections = true
*.visualizer1.transportConnectionVisualizer.iconColor = "green, yellow"
```

The `NetworkNodeVisualizer` module creates the visualization figures for all other visualizers. By default, the two visualizer modules in the network each use their own NetworkNodeVisualizer. The NetworkNodeVisualizer modules would create overlapping visualizations, so `visualizer2` has to be configured to display its visualizations using `visualizer1's networkNodeVisualizer` module. The following keys achieve this:

```
*.visualizer2.networkNodeVisualizerType = ""
*.visualizer2.*.networkNodeVisualizerModule = "visualizer1.networkNodeVisualizer"
```

When the simulation is run, this happens:

<p><video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" src="advanced3.mp4" width="864" height="610"></video></p>

The server starts sending the UDP and TCP streams to the hosts. The
paths of UDP packets are indicated with red arrows, and the paths of TCP
packets with blue arrows. The statistics for the UDP and TCP packets are
displayed above the affected nodes. The number of received UDP packets
at the server is just two, which are the two video stream request
packets from the hosts. The received UDP packets at `hosts 2 and
4` keep increasing. The received TCP data is displayed above the
TCP hosts. TCP connection visualization icons are differentiated based
on the letters in the icons, as the
`TransportConnectionVisualizer` is using just one color.

### Visualizing multiple radio mediums

V1

This example simulation features two wireless networks, which operate in different frequency bands (2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz.) The two wireless networks are in independent frequency bands, and thus can operate concurrently without interfering with each other. The simulation can be optimized by configuring the two wireless networks to use two different radio medium modules. This way radio medium modules have to send transmissions only to those hosts that can receive them. The transmissions on the two radio mediums can only be visualized using two visualizer modules.

TODO: actually, the same can be achieved by one radio medium and one visualizer, but it is not efficient

V2

This example simulation features two wireless networks operating in non-interfering frequency bands (2.4 and 5 GHz.)

- there is no interference
- the radioMedium still sends every transmission to every node, regardless of the node's ability to receive it
- when it is certain that some nodes wont receive a transmission, because it is certain they are out of range
- or they operate in different frequency bands
- it can be useful to have two radio medium modules, and put the separate networks on their own radio medium
- this way transmission are only sent to nodes that can receive it. this can optimize performance.

key things: the radio medium sends transmission to all nodes, even those that are out of range or on different
channels or frequency bands. The simulation can be optimized by putting those hosts that are known not to interfere to different radio mediums.

V3

Radio medium modules send all transmissions in the network to all wireless nodes. The individual nodes calculate wether or not they can receive the transmissions correctly. When there are multiple wireless networks, and it is certain that they cannot receive each other's transmissions (e.g. they are out of range or operate on different channels or frequency domainsa), the simulation can be optimized by putting each wireless network on a different radio medium.

The `MediumVisualizer` module can visualize transmissions from just one radio medium, so more visualizer modules are needed if there are multiple radio medium modules. This example simulation features two wireless networks, which operate in different frequency bands (2.4 and 5 GHz.) The two networks are put on two different radio mediums, and two visualizer modules are used for visualizing transmissions.

<p><video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" src="Wireless2.mp4"></video></p>

Note that even though the two signals overlap, the transmissions are received correctly at both wireless networks, because the signals are in different frequency bands and don't interfere with each other.

TODO: configure them to 2.4 and 5 GHz or just say it doesnt matter or just use different wifi channels

## Modifying visualizer parameters at runtime

Visualizer parameters are usually set from the ini file, but it is also
possible to modify some of the parameters in the graphical runtime
environment. The modified parameters take effect immediatelly. This is
useful for tuning the visualizer parameters, as one doesn't have to
close and restart qtenv to see the effects of the parameter changes. The
following parameters react to changes in qtenv:

-   `display flag`: used to turn visualizations on and off
-   `filters`: various filters like node, packet, and interface
    filters
-   `format string`: used to customize how information is
    displayed

The parameters can be changed by clicking on the appropriate visualizer
module in the network. The parameters are displayed in the inspector
panel to the right (make sure children mode is selected at the top of
the panel.)

The changes will take effect immediatelly.

## Including your own visualizers in the integrated visualizer modules

It is possible to replace the specific visualizer types in the compound visualizer modules with your own
for example you have a CustomRoutingTableCanvasVisualizer module, you can use that in IntegratedCanvasVisualizer
instead of the default RoutingTableCanvasVisualizer module.
How to do it, illustrated with screenshots
