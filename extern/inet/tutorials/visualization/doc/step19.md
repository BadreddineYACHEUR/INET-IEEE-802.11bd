## Goals

Wireless signal strength is usually reduced when it encounters an obstacle and 
it can lead to data loss. It is not always clear where signal strength 
is reduced so visualizing that can help to facilitate understanding working of the simulation. 
In this step, we enable visualization of obstacle loss.
