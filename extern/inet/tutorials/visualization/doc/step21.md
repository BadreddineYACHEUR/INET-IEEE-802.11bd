## Goals

In a large network with many transport layer applications, it can be difficult 
to examine which nodes communicate with which. Visualizing transport connections 
makes it easy to identify connections by their two endpoints and it also gives 
a quick overview about the number of connections in individual nodes. In this 
step, we show how to visualize transport connections.
